## Inspiration
We have always been passionate about music and the impact it has on our lives as it is one of the most essential tools for connection globally. However, we noticed that sharing playlists and discovering new music with friends was becoming increasingly difficult. We would create a playlist on one platform, but our friends would use a different app, making it nearly impossible to share and enjoy music together. This inspired us to create a solution that would make sharing playlists and discovering new music effortless, no matter what platform our friends used.

## What it does
SongHub allows you to connect your Spotify or Apple Music Account to our app which allows us to share your public playlist and recent listening history. We bring friends together through their shared love of music and you can add all your friends on the app. This allows you to share playlists and discover new music from your friends' musical tastes, all in one centralized hub. 


One of the key features of SongHub is our three main tab screens - Home, Transfer Playlist, and Friends. These tabs allow users to view their friend's activity, add friends, and send playlists with ease. The Home tab provides a personalized feed of music activity from friends, giving users a glimpse into their musical tastes and playlists. The Transfer Playlist tab allows users to quickly and easily share playlists with their friends. And the Friends tab lets users view and discover new friends, making it easy to discover new music together.

## How we built it
SongHub was built using a combination of React Native, Node.js, and MongoDB. React Native provided the framework for the app's frontend, allowing us to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

The backend of the app was built using Node.js and MongoDB. Node.js allowed us to create a fast and efficient server, while MongoDB provided a scalable and flexible database solution. The combination of these technologies allowed us to store and retrieve user data quickly and efficiently, providing a smooth experience for our users.

To handle the authentication, we created a custom-made authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This allowed us to securely store user information and ensure that only authorized users had access to sensitive data.

We used the Spotify Web API to allow users to connect their Spotify accounts and view their playlists. This integration allowed us to provide a rich and personalized experience for our users, and made it easy for them to share their playlists with their friends.

## Challenges we ran into
Bringing SongHub to life was a journey filled with challenges. Our original goal was to connect the API's provided by Apple Music and Spotify, allowing users to share playlists and discover new music, no matter what platform they used. However, we ran into some roadblocks while working with Apple's API, which ultimately forced us to scrap the idea for version 1. This was a difficult decision, but we felt it was necessary to prioritize the user experience. 

Time was another major challenge we faced. We had set an ambitious goal to produce a fully functioning app in just 36 hours, but we quickly realized that our timeline was overly optimistic. This meant that we had to make some tough choices and prioritize the most essential features for version 1, leaving some of our more complex ideas for later.

Additionally, getting familiarized with new frameworks and technologies was a challenge for many of our team members. Integrating the backend and frontend was also a significant challenge, but we were able to overcome these obstacles and deliver a functional product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're extremely proud of the accomplishments we've made with SongHub. Our user interface is fully functional and provides a seamless experience for users. We've also implemented a custom-made authentication system, allowing users to log in easily and securely. Additionally, our integration with Spotify's login system makes connecting your account quick and hassle-free. 

We're confident that the combination of our user-friendly interface and powerful features will make SongHub the go-to app for music lovers. These accomplishments are just the beginning, and we're excited to continue improving and expanding upon the app in the future.

## What we learned
Working on SongHub has been an incredibly valuable learning experience. We've gained a deeper understanding of the challenges and complexities involved in developing a functional and user-friendly app.

One of the biggest lessons we learned was the importance of being realistic about timelines and project scope. 
Another key lesson was the value of teamwork and collaboration. By working together and leveraging each other's strengths, we were able to overcome the challenges we faced and deliver a functional product.

## What's next for SongHub
We plan to integrate more platforms like Apple Music, SoundCloud and Youtube Music to the app which would allow our users to connect more platforms to the app, and view their friend's listening habits accross multiple platforms and share playlists amongst them.
Our goal is to bring people together through their shared love of music, and we can't wait to see how TuneShare will bring friends closer through their shared musical experiences.
